# UNCSAILApplicationPaper
Note that GameClass is just defining a class for each game that Mikolas plays to be an object of. The GameDataSifter file contains functions that separate the data
into games, each containing pitches, events, and outcomes as attributes. I then use these game objects in the GameAnalyzerFunction file to analyze all of the data
and produce the graphs used in the paper.
